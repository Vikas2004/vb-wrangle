- The assigned play was Tragedy part 2.

- The file data.txt contans the data on which the bash commands are used.

- I was asked to count the number of times MENENIUS and MARCIUS spoke during the play and store the result in the respective files and also yo find the sum and store the same to another output file.

## The command used to find the Speaker 1:
```Powershell
grep -i 'MENENIUS' data.txt -c
```
- This returns the MENENIUS count present in the data.

## The command used to find the Speaker 2:
```Powershell
grep -i 'MARCIUS' data.txt -c
```
- This returns the MARCIUS count present in the data.

- The above results are stored respectively in the meneniusCount.txt and marciusCount.txt files.

- The sum of both the counts is stored in the result.txt file.

## Commands to add the meneniusCount and marciusCount:
```Powershell
read a< 'marciusCount.txt'
read b< 'menenniusCount.txt'
printf "%d\n" $(( $a + $b )) > result.txt
```
- The above commands will store the sum of the both the counts of the file and return the result to the file named result.txt.
